To create post or comment on your post or another users you must login to create a profile that will be your google login information.

Why I chose Junky. I choose to make this app as a starting point to create a user friendly app to post items for sale that you no longer want. After moving so many times I constantly had thingsI did not wnat to take with me, so I thought I would build an app that can post my unwanted Junk (hence the name of the app).
